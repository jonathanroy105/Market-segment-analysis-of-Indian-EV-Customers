This minor project presents a comprehensive market segmentation analysis of the Indian electric vehicle
(EV) industry using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The project aims to identify distinct
customer segments based on demographic, psychographic, and behavioral factors, such as age
group, income level, technology adoption, and environmental consciousness. Four unique market
segments were identified, providing insights into customer preferences and purchasing
intentions. The results offer actionable recommendations for targeted marketing and product
strategies tailored to each segment. Future improvements, including the use of advanced machine
learning models and additional data acquisition, are proposed to refine the segmentation.
